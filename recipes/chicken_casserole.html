    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        7 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer noodles to the prepared casserole
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>Top noodles with chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese.</li>
      <li>
        Mix together condensed soup, milk, and sour cream in a medium bowl until
        combined; spoon over noodle mixture in the casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bread crumbs
        and Parmesan cheese in hot butter until crumbs are well coated, 2 to 3
        minutes. Sprinkle over casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and lightly
        browned, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Allow to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
